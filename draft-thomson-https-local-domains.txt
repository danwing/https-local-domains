                        HTTPS for Local Domains
                draft-thomson-https-local-domains-latest

Abstract

   This specification eliminates security warnings when connecting to
   local domains using TLS.  Servers use a long hostname which encodes
   their public key that is validated against the public key presented
   in the TLS handshake.

1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Operation

   Server uses a unique host name that includes a hash of its public key
   using a local domain name (Section 9).  When clients connect to such
   a local domain name (Section 9) using TLS they validate the name's
   hash matches the key in the TLS ServerHello, and continue
   communication.

   This system does not require storage on the client.

4.  Unique Host Names

   Web browsers and other application clients store per-host state using
   the host name, including cached form data such as passwords,
   integrated and 3rd party password managers, cookies, and other data.
   When a name collision occurs (e.g., the same printer.local name on
   two different networks) the client cannot recognize a different host
   is being encountered.  While it is possible to extend all of these
   clients to extend their index to include the server's public key,
   this seems to lack business justification for the engineering effort
   to solely improve the user experience (short name, Section 8) on
   local networks.

   A unique name can be created by embedding the hash of the public key
   into the name itself.  This achieves uniqueness and is also used by
   the client to validate the server's public key Section 6.  Details on
   encoding are in Section 7.

   To ease clients connecting to these long names, servers SHOULD
   advertise their long names on the local network [DNS-SD].

5.  Raw Public Keys

   Todo: rewrite this section

   Certificates are complicated for most people.  They also have an
   expiration date.  This system uses a public key for the lifetime of
   the device, which is hopefully years.  A certificate is not
   appropriate; a raw public key is more approporiate.

6.  Validation

   The client connects to a unique hostname and sends a TLS ClientHello.
   As the client only needs the raw public key, the request MAY include
   a request for a raw public key [RFC7250].  The client parses the
   returned certificate or raw public key to extract the public key and
   compare its hash with the hash contained in the hostname.  If they
   match, the TLS session continues.  If they do not match, the client
   might warn the user (as is common today) or simply abandon the TLS
   connection.

   If a certificate is returned both its 'NotBefore' and 'NotAfter'
   dates are ignored for purposes of this specification.

7.  Encoding Details

   The general format is hostname, a period, a digit indicating the hash
   algorithm, and then the hash.  The binary hash output is first base64
   encoded and then url encoded [RFC3986] (as base64 encoding contains
   some reserved URI characters).  Currently only SHA256 hash is defined
   with value "0" and can be extended (Section 11).

      Note there is no separator between the hash-algorithm identifier
      and the hash itself.  This reduces unecessary periods..

      friendly-name = 1*63(ALPHA / DIGIT)

      hash-algorithm = 0   ; 0=SHA256

      hash = 1*62(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~")
           ; valid chars from RFC3986.  62+1 octet limit from RFC1035

      encoded-hostname = friendly-name "."
                         hash-algorithm
                         hash

   An example encoding is shown in Appendix B.

8.  Short Names

   Long host names containing encoded public keys are awkward for users.
   This section describes how short names can also be advertised by
   servers and securely validated by clients, so that the short name is
   presented to users while the long name is used to actually connect.

   The server advertises both its (long) unique name and its short
   nickname using [DNS-SD].  The client connects to the long name and
   performs a full TLS handshake and validation (Section 6).  The client
   then connects to the short nickname and performs a full TLS
   handshake.  If the same public key was presented by both TLS
   connections, the client SHOULD present both the long name and short
   name to the user.

   To avoid the problems described in Section 4, the TLS connection to
   the printer MUST always use the long name.  Thus, if a user types
   printer.local, and the client has validated that short name as
   described above, the client SHOULD make the TLS connection to the
   long name.  The short name MUST NOT be used by clients after the TLS
   handshake and the server MUST terminate the TLS handshake after the
   Finished message by sending TLS close_notify.

      Discuss: we could avoid the server advertising its short name by
      having client simply remove remove the hash in the middle?

9.  Local Domain Names

   The following domain name suffixes are considered 'local' for
   purposes of this document: .local ([mDNS]), .home-arpa ([Homenet]),
   and .internal ([I-D.davies-internal-tld]).

10.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

11.  IANA Considerations

   New registry for hash type, 0=SHA256, further extensions via IETF
   Action.

   Converted to binary format (DER), then hashed with SHA256, gives this
   hex value:

   Converting that hex value to binary and base64 encoded gives:

   IevA0A6Y48solzjiwJHlMsStgkDgNlsiBnoUSWk+Whg=

   After urlencoding gives:

   IevA0A6Y48solzjiwJHlMsStgkDgNlsiBnoUSWk%2BWhg%3D%0A

   The hash algorithm digit prefixes that urlencoded output, giving:

   0IevA0A6Y48solzjiwJHlMsStgkDgNlsiBnoUSWk%2BWhg%3D%0A

   Finally, if this is a printer named "printer" advertised using
   ".local", the resulting FQDN would be:

   printer.0IevA0A6Y48solzjiwJHlMsStgkDgNlsiBnoUSWk%2BWhg%3D%0A.local
